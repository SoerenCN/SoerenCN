- 👋 Hi, I’m @SoerenCN
- 👀 I’m interested in learning developing tools and source control such as Git, Github and Gitlab both for work-related tasks and own interest.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Git and Gitlab
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on -- I am just starting out as a beginner, so my focus right now is on learning how to use the platforms, so I can be of assistance to my team.
